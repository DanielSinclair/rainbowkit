# Chains

## Customizing chains

### Customizing the initial chain

By default, RainbowKit will connect to the first chain provided via the `initialChain` prop.

The initial chain can be configured using a chain ID.

```tsx
<RainbowKitProvider initialChain={1}>
```

As a convenience, you can also pass a chain object.

```tsx
<RainbowKitProvider initialChain={mainnet}>
```
